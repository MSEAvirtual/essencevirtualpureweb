Our CEO & Co-founder, Dandria \"Dani Jo\" Williams  decided to go natural after growing passionate about wearing her hair proudly in front of her students in the ballet classes she taught in Chicago. Her husband, recording artist, T. L. Williams started his natural hair journey in 2018. Emerging as a pop duo in 2020, known as RubyGld Smoke, their natural hair triggered questions from the black community on how to  care for their own textured hair..The two have participated in campaigns with Luster’s Pink, affectionately known for their Pink Lotion where they advocated sulfur-free and natural hair products for black women and men. In 2021, they decided to enter the natural hair care business due to the lack of resources and knowledge on how to grow and manage textured hair.\r\nShateria Beauty offers customizable and standard wash day boxes shipped straight to your door! We feature and SUPPLY products from black-owned brands. We EDUCATE subscribers on how to manage, style and care for their hair. We EMPOWER the black community to wear the natural crown of our heritage. \"S.E.E at Shateria Beauty YOUR HAIR COMES FIRST.\"",
